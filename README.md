# 🧠 NDU CERTILOG  
### *AI-Powered Certificate Recognition & Auto-Logging System*

---

## 📋 Overview  
**NDU CERTILOG** is an AI-driven system that automates the process of recording faculty and student achievements by scanning certificate images and updating backend databases automatically.

Traditionally, faculty and students manually enter details from certificates into spreadsheets — a process that’s time-consuming and prone to errors.  

CERTILOG eliminates this by:  
- Using **AI + OCR** to read text directly from uploaded certificate images.  
- **Parsing and validating** the extracted data (Name, Event, Date, Issuer).  
- **Automatically updating** the institution’s backend database (faculty or student profile).  

✅ No manual entry  
✅ Accurate data mapping  
✅ Improved productivity and reporting
